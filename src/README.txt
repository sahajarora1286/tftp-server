hELLO
this iteration has the source code files :Client.java ,intermediateHost.java,ClientUI.java, and Server.java,Utility.java,Constants.java
it also has the UML AND UCM DIAGRAMS CORRESPONDING TO THEM
to start the code, you have to first run the Server class , which will ask you to write commands, but you do not need to write anything, since the variables that are supposed
to be assignet to some returned values from the commands are assigned to default values,then you start the ClientUI class , you type help to see the commands,in that class you 
create read requests and write requests, you just type wrq and rrq for that and then you specify the filepath, and the mode and it should work perfectly.
THANK YOU.
